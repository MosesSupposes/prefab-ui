## Prefab Design System

***This section is for contributors to the project.***

This section is likely not necessary for you as it goes into the WHY of the decisions made with each component. If you can, I encourage you to stop reading this and go build something epic instead.

### Principles

Principles bring clarity when making any decision. They are easy to remember while reducing complex problems into simple terms. In the effort of making decisions easier contributors follow three guiding principles.

- Build for **scale**.
- Build for **modularity**.
- Build for **universal appeal**.
