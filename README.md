## Prefab Design System

***This section is for contributors to the project.***

This section is not necessary for the average developer as it goes into the WHY of the decisions made with each component. If you can, I encourage you to stop reading this and go build something epic. save you time and that's what this project is all about.

Principles:

- Build for **scale**.
- Build for **modularity**.
- Build for **universal appeal**.
